# Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-ML-models
In this work, we build multiple machine learning models that increase the efficiency and sensitivity of credit risk analysis using descriptive and predictive analytics. These models are applied on a set of training data and the resulting features are implemented on a separate set of test data to gain insight about the models.
